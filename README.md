# Hand-Tracker-1
First hand tracker prototype. Goal is to use a hand gesture as a passcode to ring my doorbell. (I live on K road and a lot of unruly folks pass by my door I want to know the person outside.)

If it isn't working, type this into the terminal in the same directory:

pip install opencv-python

pip install pylance

pip install mediapipe

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y libgl1
