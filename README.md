# Hand-Tracker-1
First hand tracker prototype. Goal is to use a hand gesture as a passcode to ring my doorbell. Thumb position doesn't matter, as long as pinky and index fingers are held up.

If it isn't working, type this into the terminal in the same directory:

pip install opencv-python

pip install pylance

pip install mediapipe

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y libgl1
